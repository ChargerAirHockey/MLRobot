'''
Neural Network will have outputs that will be either 1 or 0.
Based on the outputs, These functions will be called.
For example: The hitpuck_5 output will call the hitpuck function with an intensity of 5.
'''

def hitpuck(intensity):
    # output to motor based on intensity
    print(intensity)


def moveleft(intensity):
    # move robot left based on intensity
    print(intenisty)

def moveright(intensity):
    # move robot right based on intensity
    print(intensity)
